# RLdecoding
RLdecoding is a collection of Python and Tensorflow scripts to learn Bit Flipping decoding through Reinforcement Learning.

Additional details are contained in this paper:

## Parity Check matrices

The Parity Check (PC) matrices for the following codes are contained in the `Hmat` folder:
 - Reed–Muller (RM) codes:
   - RM(2,5)
   - RM(3,6)
   - RM(3,7)
   - RM(4,7)
 
 - Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) codes: 
   - BCH(63,45)

The suffix denotes:
 - `_std`: standard PC matrix
 - `_oc`: overcomplete PC matrix (the rows are dual codewords)
 

## Getting Started
The complete simulation code will be posted soon. Stay tuned!
